# GetCleanDataAssign3

## run_analysis.R
This file will read several data sets from different files and come up witha tidy data set in the following orders:

Step 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Step 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Step 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

Step 4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

Step 5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## How it works:

You just need to source this R file, and if the root directory "UCI HAR Dataset" is in R working directory, it will work on the data set and create a tidy data set out of it.
